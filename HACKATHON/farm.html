                            Different crops require different soils, nutrients, and amounts of water. The growing season and the 
                            climate where the plant is cultivated also affect how much water it needs. The key to effective crop 
                            farming is proper crop selection. Several crucial criteria for crop selection include;

                    TIPS FOR SOIL PREPRATION

                            The soil that will be used for growing crops is prepared by ploughing, levelling, and 
                            manuring. The act of ploughing involves digging and loosening the soil, which aids in good 
                            soil aeration. In the levelling process, the earth is dispersed uniformly and levelled. The soil 
                            is then fertilised. Several factors, including soil texture, compaction, cation exchange 
                            capability, and organic matter content, might affect crop development.
                            You have a better chance of farming success if you plant crops that are compatible with the 
                            properties of your soil. Growers can adjust soil characteristics by using certain cultivation 
                            techniques, adding amendments, utilising specific planting techniques, or using technologies 
                            to change variables like soil temperature, moisture retention, and other things.

                    TIPS FOR PLANTING SEEDS
                    <dl>
                        <dd>
                            The primary step in sowing is choosing seeds from high-quality crop strains. Sowing is the 
                            process of dispersing these seeds across a field once the soil has been prepared. Manual 
                            labour, hand labour, and seed drilling machinery are all acceptable methods of sowing 
                            seeds. In a small area, some crops, like paddy, are first raised as seedlings before being 
                            moved to the main field. The majority of farmers are unable to afford superior seeds 
                            because of their excessive costs.
