                A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system with a low-pressure center, strong winds,
                and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain.<br /> The term "tropical" refers to
                its origin over tropical seas.<br /> The term "cyclone" refers to their cyclonic nature, with wind
                blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern
                Hemisphere.<br /> Warm tropical oceans lead to high evaporation, high humidity and relatively light
                winds.<br /> If these conditions persist long enough, they can combine to produce the violent winds,
                high waves, torrential rains, and floods.<br /> Cyclones typically weaken rapidly over land where they
                are cut off from their primary energy source.<br /> Also, the energy gets weakened after collision with
                vegetation and infrastructures on land mass.<br /> For this reason, coastal regions are particularly
                vulnerable to damage from a tropical cyclone as compared to inland regions. Heavy rains,
                however, can cause significant flooding inland, and storm surges can produce extensive coastal
                flooding up to 40 km from the coastline.<br /> Most of the tropical cyclone occurs during six months
                period from June to November.<br /> Tropical cyclone occurs both at sea and/or on land.<br /> Worldwide
                about 1.9 million people have died in the last two centuries due to tropical cyclones.<br /> Wide spread
                flooding after cyclone lead to increased infection and mosquito-borne illnesses.<br /> Unsanitary
                conditions in cyclone shelters increase the risk of disease propagation.<br /> Tropical cyclones
                significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the
                hampering of reconstruction efforts.<br /> A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system with a

                    <li>Provision of wind-brake plantation</li><br />
                    Wind-brake help in reducing the wind speed.<br />Promotion of several tiers of wind-brake plants
                    near the sea coast effectively reduce wind speed.<br /> Also, it helps reducing the adverse effects
                    of
                    high tides by lowering the amount of saline water and sand mass.<br /> Suitable plant species for
                    wind-brake system include casuarina, eucalyptus and acacia.<br /> Provision of wind-brake at village
                    level or even at farm level will be added advantage.<br /> In low-lying coastal areas, village
                    boundaries are often provided with embankments to prevent flood water.<br /> Drainage channels
                    (Khalasi) are provided for effective drainage.<br /> Provision of wind-brake plantation on such
                    embankments is useful for reducing the wind speed and providing fuel wood and timber.<br />

                    Cyclonic rainfall and waterlogging forces the farmer for delaying field preparation and planting
                    of winter season vegetables. Post-cyclone rainfall may damage the vegetable nursery. Vegetable
                    seedlings should be raised under low cost poly houses for getting healthy seedlings, advance in
                    the season. Creeper vegetables like water melon, pumpkin, ridge gourd, cucumber, and bitter
                    gourd are planted at a wider spacing and these crops are not suitable for transplanting. Seedlings
                    of these crops can be raised in disposable plastic cups using fertile soil in poly houses or other
                    protected places. Such seedlings can be planted early the cropping season can be advanced by 3
                    to 4 weeks.
                    
                    <li>Bio Drainage Plants</li><br/>
                    Waterlogging in coastal region due to high and unusual rainfall during cyclone coupled with
                    insufficient drainage lead to flooding in wider areas.<br/> Biological drainage by specific kind of
                    vegetation like casuarina, eucalyptus is a promising tool to improve drainage situation.<br/> Cyclones
                    occurring in the months of October and November affect the paddy crop in grain filling to
                    maturity stage.<br/> Bio-drainage plants help to reduce the water table at a faster rate and thereby,
                    facilitate in growing the winter season crops like water melon, black gram, ridge gourd,
                    cucumber, cowpea.<br/>

                FAMINE
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Famine had been a recurrent feature of life in the Indian sub-continental countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh,
                most accurately recorded during British rule.<br/> Famines in India resulted in more than 30 million deaths over the course
                of the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries.<br/> Famines in British India were severe enough to have a substantial impact on
                the long-term population growth of the country in the 19th and early 20th centuries.<br/>
                Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on climate: a favorable southwest summer monsoon is critical in securing water
                for irrigating crops.<br/> Droughts, combined with policy failures, have periodically led to major Indian famines,
                including the Bengal famine of 1770, the Chalisa famine, the Doji bara famine, the Great Famine of 1876–1878, and the
                Bengal famine of 1943.<br/> Some commentators have identified British government inaction as a contributing factor to
                the severity of famines during the time India was under British rule.<br/> Famine largely ended by the start of the 20th
                century with the 1943 Bengal famine being an exception related to complications during World War II.<br/> In India,
                traditionally, agricultural laborers and rural artisans have been the primary victims of famines. In the worst famines,
                cultivators have also been susceptible.

                    <li>Humanitarian aid</li><br/>
                    To address the immediate crisis, begin with general food distributions, followed by targeted food aid, along with the
                    provision of heath care, clean drinking water, and sanitation.<br/> This should be followed quickly with supply of modern
                    inputs and health care to aid vulnerable groups, in order to prevent epidemics and reduce the movement of people in
                    search of food.<br/> Humanitarian organizations must also weigh whether to give direct food aid or cash assistance, depending
                    on the country and community contexts.<br/> Delivery of food to affected populations has high transaction costs, but in
                    places where food markets do not exist or function well, cash payments may be a less effective means to save lives.<br/>
                    
                    <li>Rebuild communities</li><br/>
                    While food or cash assistance is a good beginning, quick follow-up with communities that are starting to rebuild and
                    relatively safe from violent conflict is essential.<br/> Rebuilding typically involves invigorating local economies through
                    safety net programs such as public works—for example, employing abled-bodied individuals to construct irrigation
                    systems, feeder roads, and other essential infrastructure.<br/> There is always the danger of a relapse into conflict and the
                    loss of these rebuilt structures, but this is an important step towards helping the affected population to return to
                    normal lives.<br/> Restoring food production through the distribution of inputs such as fertilizer and high-quality seeds is
                    also an important short-term goal.<br/>

                    <li>Strengthen local food system resilience</li><br/>
                    As rebuilding takes hold, communities must begin to stand on their own feet; this depends on efforts to build resilient
                    food systems.<br/> Below are the pathways for rebuilding resilient food systems in conflict zones:<br/>
                        <Img src="https://github.com/lakshaysharma2876/hackathon/blob/main/HACKATHON/img/framework.png"></img>
                    Organizations must identify and work to strengthen all the factors that contribute to resilience, shifting their focus
                    from just “relief to development” to “relief to resilience.”.<br/> Food systems that have high resilience are likely to be
                    self-sustaining in the long run—even under conflict conditions.<br/> For example, strengthening resilience requires
                    providing communities appropriate, up-to-date crop technologies, making sure those are adopted, and strengthening
                    institutional support for research, agricultural extension services, and policy making.<br/>
